Open the file
Read the file for any dates matching today's date
If the dates match, send notification
Place the birth years of each person in the birthdays file - use test ages for now
Use Regex to scan the file for birth years # Didn't actually have to do this, but it would have been interesting
Subtract birth year from current year
The result is stored in 'age'
Send 'age' to notify_me() as an argument alongside 'name'
Test program
Place in Windows 10 'run' folder
