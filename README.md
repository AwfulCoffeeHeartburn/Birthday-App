# Birthday-App
Second go at this...

I've made a birthday reminder app before but I over-complicated it. This time I kept it simple and didn't try to do too much at once. 
I'll add a feature that reminds you a week or two, or some other specified time, prior to a birthday on the list.

Basically all this app does so far is send a system notification when todays date is the same date as a bithday on the list.
For privacy reasons I didn't include the list of birthdays I'm using.
